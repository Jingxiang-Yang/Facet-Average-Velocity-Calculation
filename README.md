# DDT-Average-Velocity-Calculation
Code for Average Velocity Calculation in ‘Facet-Dependent Lethality of a Contact Insecticide Crystal’ by Yang et al.

Code Files:

velocity_calculation.m calcualtes the average velocity of insects in each Petri dish, and output the velocity-time data as MATLAB data file.

Plot_bioassay_data.m plots the velocity-time curves based on the velocity-time data calculated by velocity_calculation.m and KT(knochdown time)-mortality curves.

Data Files:

D. melanogaster_DDTfacets_velocity.mat were velocity-time data calclated by velocity_calculation.m based on the bioassay videos of female fruit flies (D. melanogaster) exposed to various facets of DDT single crystals.

D. melanogaster_DDTfacets KT.xlsx were KT(knochdown time)-mortality data for female fruit flies (D. melanogaster) exposed to various facets of DDT single crystals. The knockdown time was measured for each insect manually.
